# Food at the Hub
## Is there food at Communitch Hub?

Oftentimes, there is food at Communitech Hub. But if you're REALLY REALLY lazy, it'd be nice to just pop open your browser or an app and find out if someone's put something yummy out.

This is a test project for the Communitech Apps Factory. It features a database, Rails server, API, web page and mobile client.

## Directory Structure

Because this is going to be hosted on Heroku and I'm too lazy to break it into multiple repositories, everything that isn't part of the rails project is in the Other directory.
